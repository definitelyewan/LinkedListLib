# LinkedListLib
LinkedListLib is a library containing a doubly linked list data structure and list iterator data structure. The library can be compiled using gcc, clang, or MSVC and is coded using the c99 standard.

The official repo for this library is located at https://github.com/definitelyewan/LinkedListLib

@section main-features Features

LinkedListLib provides an easy way to interact with and create a linked list data structure. The caller
can also create a list iterator to avoid interacting with the linked list structure itself and for ease of
use. The structure itself is completely user-programmable and provides functionality for transforming a 
list into a string, performing a deep copy, deleting data, comparing data, and printing data to a console.

### The LinkedListLib library provides:

 - Adding and removing data from a linked list
 - User programmable compare, free, print, copy and string functionality
 - List iterators
 - Different insert functions
 - Searchable list
 - 100% test coverage

All testing and development was done on Windows 10, Fedora 38, and Debian 12
